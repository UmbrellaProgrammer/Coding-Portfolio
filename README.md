**Portfolio Website**

A simple website built in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the purpose
of sharing my information and skill set with potential employers.
The site provides links to GitHub and demonstrates my rudimentary abilities in
responsive web design.

**TODO:**

- Adjust Projects section to be more extensible as new projects are developed
- Add more projects to Projects section
- Replace placeholder images in My Workflow gallery with intended photos
- Choose a better font for the pop-out nav bar and footer nav bars
