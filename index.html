            <h2>Need a developer?</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Troy, a junior software engineer in California. I have
              professional experience in Java and SQL, and educational
              experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My experience is
              primarily object-oriented design in the MVC pattern, as well as
              simple database construction and management. I strive for my code
              to always be readable, modular, scalable, and to adhere to the
              SOLID principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my career as a teacher. While working on the PhD in
              History at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I lived with
              two Computer Science PhDs and became curious about the strange
              code they always wrote. Curiosity turned to conversation, and
              conversation turned to investigation. Eventually I left my program
              to become a software developer, but not before completing the
              Master's and publishing two books.
            </p>
            <p>
              Self-study is the superpower of grad students everywhere, and I
              used mine to cultivate a knowledge of programming. When I was
              ready, I became the student of a staff engineer with 20 years'
              experience in software development, who later hired me for my
              first dev role. To this day, I still read programming and computer
              science books, because I know that I can never know enough. I
              don't want to be proficient. I want to be <i>the best.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Those housemates, by the way? Now a Stanford Lecturer and a GAFAM
              Senior Engineer - both of whom are eager to recommend me as your
              newest developer.

              <h2>Back End</h2>
              <p>
                My previous company's flagship application processed check
                transactions at car dealerships nationwide. I contributed
                modular features, including extending the number of possible
                transaction types and their business logic. I also debugged the
                application extensively. Our tech stack included Java / Java EE,
                WebSphere, and SQL.
              </p>

              <h2>Front End</h2>
              <p>
                I built a few in-house applications as quality-of-life
                improvements for our dev team, including a proprietary Base64
                encoder/decoder (Whisper) and an automated username / password
                generator that updates a major database (KeyMaker). I designed
                their UIs in JavaFX. I also implemented themes for our flagship
                application's UI. Separately, I built hobby web apps in
                JavaScript + React, HTML, and CSS.
              </p>
              <p>Oh yeah - I also built this website!</p>

              <h2>Data Management</h2>
              <p>
                I used SQL Server Reporting Services to query and report on
                customer data in support of the development team, and I
                constructed and managed simple databases in MS SQL Server to
                further hone my skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I'm the process of transitioning my
                TeamBuilder application's data storage from text files to a
                relational database.
